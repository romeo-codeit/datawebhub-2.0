Create a professional, modern, dynamic portfolio website with the following specifications:

Pages & Structure:

Home: clean landing page, highlight your brand, hero section, smooth animations, subtle interactive elements.

About: your story, skills, experience, visually engaging but not childish.

Projects: dynamically loadable projects from a database. allow adding, updating, or removing projects without touching code. each project should have a title, description, images/videos, and optional links.

Chat: AI-powered interactive page where users can ask questions and get responses from your personal AI. integrate your 3D avatar model here with animations and lip-sync (avatar integration handled later, scaffold should provide placeholders and hooks for animation tracks, blend shapes, and lip-sync data).

Animations & Effects:

Chat page: the 3D avatar should support multiple animations (idle, waving, cheering, head nod/shake, talking, backflip) and blend shapes for facial expressions. the avatar should visually react to chat input with expressions and lip-sync.

Other pages: include wow, modern animations (particles, object animations, scrolling triggers) that are smooth, interactive, and visually impressive—but not cartoonish. some animations should be continuous, some triggered by user actions.

Backend & Database:

fully functional backend with API endpoints to serve project data and handle chat AI queries.

integrate Appwrite for database:

collections for projects and chat history

support querying, adding, updating, and deleting data

endpoints ready to accept AI input/output for the avatar’s responses

AI chat engine should support integrating an external model later and should be ready to store/retrieve responses dynamically.


Frontend:

Next.js or React + Vite with TypeScript.

Tailwind CSS for styling.

responsive design across devices.

design theme: light sage green (#C2E7C9) as primary background, warm orange (#F2AC20) for CTAs, calming blue (#4265D6), soft navy (#293B55) for text.

clean, modern fonts matching the theme. choose complementary fonts for headings and body text.

fully dynamic system for loading project content from the database (JSON structure).

Integration Points:

placeholders for 3D avatar and its animations, lip-sync, and blend shapes. scaffold should include hooks to plug in the avatar and its data later without touching backend or front-end logic.

support external AI text-to-speech integration for avatar’s responses.

Features & WOW Factor:

interactive elements across the site (scroll-triggered animations, hover effects, smooth transitions).

AI chat page is the centerpiece with avatar integration.

dynamic content system so projects, chat responses, and any AI interactions are fully editable via the database.

scalable code architecture so future AI/3D integrations are seamless.

Deliverables:

production-ready, fully functional scaffold.

backend routes ready for AI and database interactions.

frontend dynamic pages with placeholders for avatar.

no placeholder text for backend; all endpoints should function with example/mock data.

frontend design should match the theme and include suggested animations for wow effect.

Additional Notes:

prioritize modern, professional, and visually appealing design.

do not make animations childish or overly cartoonish.

the AI avatar integration will be done later; scaffold should provide all necessary hooks, data structures, and placeholders.

the chat system should be fully ready for dynamic AI responses and integration with lip-sync/animation.
